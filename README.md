When you press the big red [+] widget of the homepage, a new roadmap is created. You can modify it by **right clicking** on its card.

Once your roadmap is ready, **left click** on it and start creating your personal roadmap!

Press the big [+] widget to add a new milestone called "Site". Then again, you can modify it by **right clicking** on its card. **Left clicking** a Site card will mark it as completed.

## 🖥️ Platforms

This software is **Windows-only** for now, if there are requests, I would be glad to build it for Linux

## 🗒️ Credits

[Lea Anthony](https://github.com/leaanthony): for creating [Wails](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails) which is an absolute beast

[Arthur Kazais](https://www.figma.com/@thearthurk): for all the icons contained in `/frontend/src/components/svg` (not the Github one) that I found on [svgrepo.com](https://www.svgrepo.com/collection/wave-oval-interface-icons/) under a Public Domain license. Amazing work!

This app has been created using the following Golang modules: `wailsapp/wails/v2`, `creasty/defaults`, `Bios-Marcel/wastebasket/v2`, `pkg/browser` and `fatih/color`
